Hi, welcome to my personal site.

I am Hongbusi, a front-end developer. Currently working in Hangzhou.

(Hongbusi is my pen name and I like it.)

If you find some strange English when reading my site, you don't have to be surprised, because I'm learning and trying to use it. I'd appreciate it if you could point it out for me.

The goal is to be a [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs) contributor, not just because [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803), [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu) is my idol. If you want to know more about me, I think you can read this site, or go to [Docs](https://hongbusi.github.io/docs) and [ToDoList](https://github.com/Hongbusi/ToDoList).

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Hongbusi), [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/Hongbusi), mail me at [coderhbs@gmail.com](mailto:coderhbs@gmail.com).

Thanks for reading, see you next time :)
